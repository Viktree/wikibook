# What is the single best argument for getting an iPhone instead of an Android?

Since there are so many technical and user experience answers, let me pull a funny one here.

## Android is like your girlfriend.

-   You have a wide variety of choices in color, size, specifications and of course the cost which suits your pocket.
-   You can customize it as you wish.
-   So much of like able glitter at the start and as days pass by the response is slower.
-   You can tear it down if you are an expert and put it back (if it doesn't allow can move on cheaply).
-   With great freedom comes a greater insecurity.

## IPhone is like your wife.

-   It controls you in every aspect.
-   No customizations
-   Comes with a heavy price but lasts longer, much longer.
-   You have to be too good to tear it down be given the cost you mostly won't if it is yours.
-   Great control results in greater security. So, it all depends on what stage of life you are and what you expect from your phone. Having a girlfriend makes sense when you're young but tying the knot makes more sense as you grow older and this is from my personal experience.
