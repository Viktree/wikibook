# Blogging

> When people ask me for advice on blogging, I always respond with yet another form of the same advice: pick a schedule you can live with, and stick to it. Until you do that, none of the other advice I could give you will matter. I don't care if you suck at writing. I don't care if nobody reads your blog. I don't care if you have nothing interesting to say. If you can demonstrate a willingness to write, and a desire to keep continually improving your writing, you will eventually be successful.

Whoever said, “you do not really understand something unless you can explain it to your grandmother” never tried detailing their opinions to a text file.

It's helpful to discuss features, but sometimes the value of a feature is inversely proportional to how much it has been discussed. Our job as software developers is to deliver features and solve business problems, not to generate neverending discussion.

### Why Blog?

-   Blogging is something that I am irrationally scared of. The only way to overcome these fears is to step out of my comfort zone and write about things.
-   I scower the internet for hours searching for an answer to a simple question, yet when I get the answer it doesn’t stick.
-   Want to make it easier to remember what I have just learned. I spent a ton of time and effort learning how docker works. Yet I never used that knowledge practically well enough for it to stick
-   Want to be able to answer stupidly easy questions that I really don’t do a good job answering. Why did I choose to go into CS? What courses did I take last semester?
-   Cunningham’s Law will save you when you are wrong
-   You’re holding yourself accountable to what you’ve learned, working to articulate it, and helping others all along the way. Furthermore, it affords opportunities that you may not be able to get otherwise.

### What do I blog about?

-   Nothing (too) wrong. I need to know enough about the topic to make the post worthwhile.

How to frame things?

-   Try to be positive, I am not a pot smoking jock in my parent’s basement. This way when there is something negative to say, its credible.
-   Write for a past version of yourself, what I wish I had someone tell me
-   Stick to your own experiences (this worked for me vs you should do this)
-   Don’t be “falsely modest”, if you know something, you know it. No need to pretend that you don't
-   write for actual human people, not “content” for an “audience”

I can respect that. Writing is hard. People spend their entire lives learning how to write effectively. It isn't something you can fake. It isn't something you can buy. You have to work at it.

That's exactly why people who are afraid they can't write should be blogging. It's exercise. No matter how out of shape you are, if you exercise a few times a week, you'll inevitably get fitter. Write a small blog entry a few times every week and you're bound to become a better writer. If you're not writing because you're intimidated by writing, well, you're likely to stay that way forever.
