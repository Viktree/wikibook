# Cold Emails

First thing is first ... expect a 50-60% Response Rate.

### Length

-   Keep it Short: “You should explain everything that you want in first two sentences. Literally everything you truly want in first five to seven words. This makes it easy for recipient to get everything you need without wasting hours of their life.
-   Don't Oversell: You don't want to be mistaken for Spam. That's the worst thing that can happen.
-   Don't Sound Desperate: Sounding desperate is likely to illicite a quick response as oppose to a thoughtful one.

### Recipient First:

-   Customize the Introduction:This sill make the mail seem more personal.
-   Acknowledge that its a cold email: Everyone knows a cold email when they see it — so go out of your way to seem human and real when doing so. One way to do this is by acknowledging fact that while it may be a cold email, you genuinely care about their feedback. Make each recipient feel wanted. That way, they’ll genuinely feel like their opinion means something to you, and hopefully it’ll solicit a response.
-   Don't Write a story: Their time is just as valuable, and in reality, nobody cares about the story. If they do, then they will defiantly ask.
-   Put their first name in the subject line: “When I put their first name in subject, I get an 83 percent open rate and a 14 percent response rate. Pretty decent compared to most cold emails.
-   If you can Find Commonality: “Try and find something you share with person you are contacting. In my case, I’ve had success checking LinkedIn and seeing if they share a contact, a group, interest or are from same university. It’s an easy way to build rapport and possibly get them to read rest of email.”
-   Usually better not to CC: Use BCC if you must

### Content:

-   If you can't think of a good subject, use "Appropriate Person": It puzzles the reader and looks like a quick problem to solve.
-   The first sentence: Should be along the lines of “I am writing in hopes of talking to the appropriate person who handles (role).
-   If you can, add value first: “ best way to develop strong business relationships is proactively think of ways to help others. A cold email is much more likely to catch attention of recipient if you find a way to add value to them first. You’ll be amazed by how much you help yourself by first thinking of ways to help others.”
-   Ask a question: “Not getting responses from a cold email? Try including a question that highlights your knowledge of recipient’s company and requests a response. This will make email more personal and initiates engagement in conversation. You can try asking if company is interested in investing time in a new business tactic, and then invite them to reply to get more information about your offerings.”
-   Propose a time/method of response: “It is much easier for me to set up a time to speak with someone when they propose a time frame that they are free to talk. It eliminates back and forth on setting a time that works for both parties. Example: I am free tomorrow between 3:00 p.m. and 6:00 p.m. EST. Please let me know when you are free within that time frame to go over our new service.”
-   Show that you can solve a problem: “Besides sounding human and being personal, email should quickly address a problem and how we can help solve it. email shouldn’t make recipient connect dots — it should make it easy for them to see value in whatever is being presented. If recipient sees how further communication would make life easier for them, they’ll want to respond."
-   Start the follow-up with thank you: Remember, they didn't have to respond
