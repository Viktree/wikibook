# Summary Writing

When writing a summary, every word should add significant meaning to the statement. Good summaries are generally not more than 250 words (1 page)

### Do's:

-   Use words that convey specific meanings
-   Only summarize after reading/writing the document
-   Remember what you want the reader to know/think
-   Stress important findings
-   take advantage of conventional structure (past, present future), (purpose, method, results, conclusion)(context, definition, option, recommendation)(context, considerations, needs, implementation)

### Don'ts:

-   Write a fancy introduction
-   write generic statements
-   Include references to other works
