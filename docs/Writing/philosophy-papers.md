# Writing in philosophy

Common Mistakes when reading philosophy:

-   reading texts as if they are novels or technical writings
-   prejudging the author
-   failing to evaluate what you read
-   trying to skim
-   not reading actively
-   Avoid exaggerations
-   Don't provide context, thats a waste of space
-   Write out your main points over and over again
-   Thesis should be no longer than a sentence
-   1 sentence thesis
-   2 for outline
-   then summery
-   then objection
-   then why that objecting is good or bad
-   read your work out loud
-   If things are awkward to say, they are awkward to read, if they are awkward to read then its probably not convincing
-   Avoid Conformation bias: Convince yourself that the argument you are trying to support is correct, otherwise it will be hard to objectivity tackle the objections
