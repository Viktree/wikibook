Password managers are the **\*\*\*\***

Why use password managers?

Consider as an example of this a world where no-one ever locks their front door when they leave the house, and someone suggests that fitting locks and actually using them might help in dealing with the spate of burglaries that have occurred recently. This would be totally unworkable. If you lost your key you’d be unable to get into your own house.
Conversely, anyone who found it or stole it could now get in. For a house with multiple occupants, you’d need to get a new key cut for everyone in the house, including any temporary guests who were staying for a few days. If a neighbor dropped by to return an item that they’d borrowed they wouldn’t be able to get in. If there was a fire then emergency services wouldn't be able to get into the house to look for people who might be trapped there. Door locks are obviously completely unworkable, and therefore not even worth trying.
