# Writing Technical Specifications

-   A **functional spec** describes the product from the user's perspective.
-   Writing a spec is a great way to nail down all those irritating design decisions, large and small, that get covered up if you donâ€™t have a spec.
-   So. Specs are good, but not if nobody reads them. As a spec-writer, you have to trick people into reading your stuff, and you should also probably make an effort not to cause any already-too-small brains to leak out through eye-sockets.

## What specs should include.

-   [ ] A disclaimer
-   [ ] One author
-   [ ] Scenarios
-   [ ] An overview
-   [ ] details, details, details
-   [ ] Open issues
-   [ ] Non-goals: requested stuff that we have decided not to do/use with good reason
-   [ ] Side Notes (Technical Notes/Documentation Notes/Testing Notes)

## Qualities of well written specs

-   [ ]  Release a copy once a week, unless there is a huge change
-   [ ]  Be funny
-   [ ]  Writing a spec is like writing code for a brain to execute
-   [ ]  Write as simply as possible
-   [ ]  Review and reread several times
-   [ ]  Templates considered harmful
