    -   My hypothesis is...
    -   The Null Hypothesis is ...

### Materials / Equipment

-   Also Important to note anything with respect to experimental setup
-   Should be testing the hypothesis
-   Sometimes diagrams that show the setup are useful
-   The more specific the better
-   Make sure to mention the quantity of each item

### Method /Procedure

-   Include Graphs/Tables to show the data visually
-   Label the Graphs and Figures properly
-   Talk about each trial separately in detail
-

    -   Do the results agree with previous findings?
    -   What are some sources of error?
    -   Did the study accomplish what you hoped to accomplish?
-   Think Critically about the work that you performed.

### Conclusions
