| Duration     | Serving         |
| :----------- | :-------------- |
| 30 mins prep | 5 small waffles |

## Ingredients

-   1 cup all-purpose flour, spooned and levelled
-   2 tablespoons sugar (last time 1 worked fine)
-   1 teaspoon baking powder (found in lazy Susan: Lower row)
-   1/4 teaspoon salt
-   1 cup milk
-   2 eggs
-   4 tablespoons (1/2 stick) unsalted butter, melted (454g) 1/4 cup
-   Maple syrup and butter, as desired, for serving

## Directions

1.  Preheat waffle iron according to manufacturer's instructions. In a large bowl, whisk flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt; set aside.


2.  In a small bowl, whisk milk and eggs; pour over flour mixture, and whisk gently to combine (don't over mix). Gently whisk in butter.


3.  Following manufacturer's instructions, cook waffles until deep brown and crisp. (For a standard waffle iron, pour a generous 1/2 cup of batter into centre, spreading to within 1/2 inch of edges, and close; waffle will cook in 2 to 3 minutes.) Serve warm, with maple syrup and butter, as desired.

**Use ladle to pour and Woden pick to pull from maker**

## Cuisinart 5-in-1 instructions

1.  Plug the power cord into a standard electrical outlet.
2.  Turn the Selector dial to the left to choose the Griddle function. The red indicator light on the Selector dial will illuminate to signal that the power is on.
3.  Set the Griddle dial to 400°F:
4.  Allow the unit to heat up. When it has reached the selected temperature, the green indicator light will illuminate. You are now ready to begin.
5.  Lift top cover of the Griddler  by grasping the handle and pushing up in one fluid motion. The top cover will stay open in a 100° position until you lower it.
6.  Pour enough batter onto the centre of the lower waffle grid to completely cover (about 1¼ cups). Use a heat-proof spatula to spread batter evenly over the grid. Close the top cover. The green light will turn off, but the red light will stay illuminated.
7.  Bake for approximately 3 minutes. For lighter waffles, bake for less time. For darker waffles, bake for more time. Medium-brown waffles, can be achieved by baking in between 3½ and  5 minutes. These are approximate times that may vary depending on the recipe ingredients used.

    > Note: During operation, the green indicator light inside the Griddle dial will continue to turn on and off as the thermostat regulates the temperature. This is normal.
    > The red indicator light inside the Selector dial will stay illuminated during operation.

8.  Remove the waffles by gently loosening the edges with a heat-proof spatula or tongs. Never use metal utensils, as they will damage the nonstick coating.
9.  When you are finished baking, turn the Selector dial to the OFF position and unplug the power cord from the wall outlet. Allow the Griddler to cool down for at least 30 minutes before handling
