# Presentation advice

1.  The Takeaway: When you are giving a presentation, only two questions matter: Who is my audience? If there is one thing that I want people to take away from the talk, what is it? Not what you want to say, its what others want to here
2.  Speak with the whole body: use hand gestures, facial expressions,
3.  Research Talks A research talk is just too short to be able to give a sensible development on the blackboard, and 35mm slides take far too much preparation.
4.  Preparation: Don't prepare slides till a day before. Instead, make sure that you understand the material
5.  Road Map: "This is what I have discussed so far, and now I'm going on to cover these areas''
6.  Balance the Material: The tension is this: you need to say enough to convey the essential content of your idea, but you must not overwhelm your audience with too much material.The best way out of this dilemma is to adopt a non-uniform approach to your talk; that is, treat some aspects in more detail than others.
7.  Be Motivating: The Awful Trap is to present only the framework and the abstraction, leaving out the motivating examples which you used to guide your work. It is utterly vital to present examples which demonstrate the points you are trying to make.
8.  Slides: Six or seven "things" on one slide is quite enough. Slides shouldn't repeat what you plan to say, but they should emphasize it; don't waste visual bandwidth on things you are also going to say.
9.  The Jitters: Do try steady, deep breathing beforehand, and relaxation exercises, but don't expect to feel calm.

##### Ordered

-   Identify the problem that we are solving. Explain it as clearly as possible
-   Compare it to other things if you have to to get that point across
-   Talk about the side effects of what we have. How we can focus our shift in time
-   Relate it to the vision

Goal: donâ€™t tell the room what you did, tell the room the most
important things they should know, but probably do not

Goal: put smart people in the best position to help you
