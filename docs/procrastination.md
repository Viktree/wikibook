Do not procrastinate. It is not as fancy as it looks earlier.

-   Most of the college students or in fact, a whole lot of people in the world like to procrastinate.
-   When you come to a college, you yourself are responsible for your actions, and this is when the concept of procrastination is seeded.
-   You have a lot of distractions, friends to get drunk with, movies to watch, football games to play, girlfriends to date, and before you know, studies become your last priority, and you start being inspired from the misinterpreted quotes like, "Live life to the fullest, live in the present, don't worry about the future.
-   Time flies and soon you are walking home with the degree.
-   Life needs to be lived on a different pattern now, and by the time you understand this, you have had paid a price for the habit. The old habit dies hard, but if you are lucky enough, you flex fast and get away after paying a small price. A lot others, it costs more, and another chunk just keeps paying the price. They keep missing the real life deadline, just because they kept sticking to a seemingly cool habit.
-   The whole process of adjusting and readjusting is very painful and strenuous, costs up to different extents and in "real" life, gives you big dents, and always leaves you wondering, "I wish I had started earlier, this would have been lot easier then."
